          I would like to welcome every student, staff, visitors, and
          prospective students alike to the
          <strong>Kulliyyah of Information and Communication Technology</strong>
          (KICT). As KICT approaches its 20th anniversary, we feel proud to
          reflect the various expansions and achievements that make the KICT
          what it is today. The previous leaderships and management teams have
          led the effort to continuously transform and improve the academic
          programme offerings and delivery, research activities and
          publications, and the various community projects and engagements.
        </p>
        <p>
          InShaAllah we will continue holding up the great legacies left behind
          by our predecessors while strengthening our efforts to embrace
          Sejahtera and sustainability. Having to go through the challenging
          times especially due to Covid19 pandemic and economic uncertainties,
          the management line-up will try our best to explore and adopt
          innovative ways to move forward. In this regard, the IIUM roadmap and
          long-term visions will continue to be our basis to help visualise and
          provide insights into guiding our plans and implementations. We call
          for staff, current and prospective students to embrace this vision and
          join us to champion the efforts and lead the way to achieve the
          visions.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we have learnt from other experts and scholars, we will advocate
          e-management principles. We will stress on automation and will promote
          integration at every possible level and opportunity we have, with the
          hope that these will optimise our efforts and resources and make us
          leaner in our way of doing things. We will try to build-in
          intelligence and use data driven decisions and strive to be dynamic
          and agile to improve our readiness to transform and embrace changes,
          and be sustainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          May Allah SWT accept all our efforts as good deeds. We seek everyone's
          support to shoulder these responsibilities.
        </p>

        <h5>KICT Building Under Construction in 2011</h5>
        <h1>
          Kulliyyah of Information and Communication Technology Establishment
        </h1>
        <div class="historyP">
          <p>
            It was at the First International Conference on Information Systems
            and Islam held in 2001 at IIUM that the then Rector of IIUM, Prof.
            Tan Sri Dr. Mohd Kamal Hassan announced the establishment of the
            Kulliyyah of Information and Communication Technology (KICT) at IIUM
            and named the first Dean of KICT.
          </p>
          <p>
            The establishment of KICT was made possible with the merger of two
            departments of the university being the Department of Information
            System (DIS) from the Kulliyyah of Economics and Management Sciences
            (KENMS) and the Department of Library and Information Sciences
            (DLIS) from Kulliyyah of Islamic Revealed Knowledge and Human
            Sciences (KIRKHS). Information Technology had and continues to bring
            about developments that have revolutionized traditional society
            signaling changes to its philosophy, culture, economy and many
            aspects of our lives. It was imperative therefore to bring together
            all studies related to Information and Communication Technology
            under one umbrella.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DIS began by offering the Bachelor in Management Information
            Systems (BMIS) programme which was later changed to the Bachelor of
            Information Technology (BIT) on the advice of the Ministry of Higher
            Education. The DIS later added postgraduate programmes namely the
            Master in Information Technology (MIT) by research and course work
            and the PhD in Information Technology (PhD IT) by research.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DLIS started off by initially offering the Master of Library and
            Information Sciences (MLIS) programme and later added on the PhD in
            Library and Information Sciences (PhD LIS) both by coursework and
            research.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Department of Computer Sciences was established in 2004 by
            offering the Bachelor of Computer Sciences (BCS) programme. This was
            followed up by offering postgraduate programmes in 2011 namely the
            Master of Computer Science (MCS) and the PhD in Computer Sciences
            (PhD CS) after due approval by the Ministry of the Higher Education.
            New programmes which are currently being developed by KICT include
            the Bachelor in Multimedia, Bachelor of Software Engineering and
            Bachelor of Library and Information Sciences.
          </p>
          <p>
            KICT is keenly aware that the education, development, application
            and utilization of technology as is being disseminated by developed
            countries may be devoid of ethical and moral perspectives. The focus
            and emphasis of ICT from the secular world is dominated mainly by
            technological advances. The uniqueness of KICT programmes and
            research is the integration of Islamic values using holistic and
            systematic approaches to achieve an equitable balance in society.
            Such an approach would pave the way for the world to use ICT for the
            positive benefit of society at large.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Centre for IT Advancement (CITA) was established in 2004 as a
            Strategic Business Unit (SBU) for KICT. From humble beginnings the
            centre has now expanded into a profitable SBU which provides
            executive academic programmes, certification programmes, short
            courses and ICT consultancy services. Among the academic programmes
            offered by CITA are the Executive Masters Programme, Postgraduate
            Diploma and Certification Programmes in Protective Security
            Management in collaboration with the Chief Government Security
            Office (CGSD) in the Prime Ministerâ€™s Department. The professional
            certification programmes include Project Risk Management, Project
            Management, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and
            Information Systems Security Management. Towards enhancing its
            reputation and improving its services, CITA has signed several
            Memoranda of Agreement with agencies such as Hewlett-Packard
            Education and the Turkish Chamber of Commerce. Recognizing the
            expertise of CITA, the top management of IIUM has entrusted CITA to
            develop a campus wide IT Security Policy.
